Inheritance --> It is one of the key properties of OOP 

we can acquire properties (features) from one class to another class

Single Inheritance --> Finger Print --> one child class inheriting properties
Multiple Inheritance --> Parents --> kids --> ome child classs can take proper 
Multilevel Inheritance --> level by level --> Family Tree
Hierarchial Inheritance --> multiple child classes inheriting from single parent
Hybrid Inheritance --> It's a combination of diff types of inheritance


Single Inheritance

class Baseclasss: #Parent class
     statement(s)......
     .....
class Derivedclass(Baseclass):
     statement(s)...
     .....

#Updating user names in a profile page

class Users:
    """Users class with basic details"""
    def __init__(self,fname,lname):
        self.fname = fname
        self.lname = lname
    def fullname(self):
        return f'{self.fname  +  self.lname}'

#u1 = Users('Layatri','Murakada')
#print(u1.fullname())
#Now we want to extend by updating user name
class Update_Users(Users):
    #pass
    def update(self):
        return f'{self.fname.title().strip()+" "+self.lname.title().strip()}'
u1=Update_Users('  Layatri ','Murakadaa ')
print(u1.fullname())
print(u1.update())
print(dir(u1))


#Usage of class attribute and class Method in inheritance

#class attributes - They can be accesed directly with class name
#class method -- @classmethod

#Banking scenario - RBI Bank (Base class) - SBI, HDFC

class RBI:
    """Base class with amount"""
    cash = 1000000  #class attribbutes
    @classmethod  #decorator
    def rbiCash(cls):
        return f"Available cash with RBI is {RBI.cash}"
rb = RBI()
print(rb.cash)
print(rb.rbiCash())
print(RBI.cash) #we can also access directly using classname
print(RBI.rbiCash())

class SBI(RBI):
    pass
b1=SBI()
print(b1.rbiCash())

class HDFC(RBI):
    cash=500000 #class attribute
    @classmethod
    def hdfc_cash(cls):
        print(f'HDFC cash is {cls.cash}')
        print(f'Total Accessible cash is {cls.cash+cls.cash}')
b1=HDFC()
print(b1.cash) #in this case as cls attribute is same so its overridden
print(b1.rbiCash())
b1.hdfc_cash()


#the same case we will access with classnames
class HDFC(RBI):
    cash=500000 #class attribute
    @classmethod
    def hdfc_cash(cls):
        print(f'HDFC cash is {cls.cash}')
        print(f'Total Accessible cash is {cls.cash+RBI.cash}')
b1=HDFC()
print(b1.cash)
print(b1.rbiCash())
b1.hdfc_cash()

#takeaway--> if same classes is having same names as class attributes
#t access them we will directly use class names as RBI.cash,HDFC.cash

#what if we have diff class attributes
class RBI:
    """Base class with amount"""
    cash = 1000000  #class attribbutes
    @classmethod  #decorator
    def rbiCash(cls):
        return f"Available cash with RBI is {RBI.cash}"

class HDFC(RBI):
    amount=500000 #class attribute
    @classmethod
    def hdfc_cash(cls):
        print(f'HDFC cash is {cls.cash}')
        print(f'Total Accessible cash is {cls.cash+RBI.cash}')
